Hi everyone interested in working with WordPress and Yeoman. <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman generators</a> are an awesome way to kickstart your projects and structure your workflows. Combined with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, you get from your theme/plugin/blogg/website-idea to coding in just a minute.

<a href="https://github.com/wesleytodd">@wesleytodd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/danielauener">@danielauener</a> started the wp-yeoman organization as a place where all efforts to team up WordPress and Yeoman could be gathered. Do you want us to add your generator, tutorial or blogpost, just give us a note: <a href="https://twitter.com/danielauener">@danielauener</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wesleytodd">@wesleytodd</a>.
