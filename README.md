Hi everyone interested in working with WordPress and Yeoman. <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman generators</a> are an awesome way to kickstart your projects and structure your workflows. Combined with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, you get from your theme/plugin/blogg/website-idea to coding in just a minute.
